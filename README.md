Firefox Nightly Installer for Ubuntu 13.10 (12.04+)
==================================================

This is a script to safely install the latest Firefox Nightly Version in Ubuntu 13.10 (actually it works with any version higher than 12.04). 

The small program do the following:

1) Downloads the nightly build, (CURRENT VERSION, FIREFOX NIGHTLY V29)
2) create an specific session (called nightly-session) and 
3) make the launchers in order to easily access to the program. 

This process has the advantage to use a different session, that allows you to try and use your Firefox Nightly without interfiering with your usuall stable version (and session) of Firefox. 

Enjoy! 
Any comments are more than welcome :)
